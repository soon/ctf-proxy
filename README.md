# CTF-Proxy

This project implements ctf-proxy utiliy, which handles 3 major problems:

1. Sniffing. ctf-proxy collects all traffic coming to your services, so you can analyze it.
2. Interception. ctf-proxy supports plug-ins to interrupt or overwrite requests and responses.
3. Monitoring. ctf-proxy provides a dashboard, where you can see status of your services, common routes, and efficiency of interceptors.
